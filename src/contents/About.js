                <p>The world of programming found me at an early age. In elementary school,
                I began to learn BASIC. Once I got to high school, I was introduced to Linux'
                and HTML. From there, I began to learn more HTML. After taking a bit of a step
                away from coding to embark upon other adventures, I made my desire to code full
                time official by beginning school, at Delgado Community College in New Orleans,
                LA; then finishing my bachelor's at Tulane University. Since then, I have worked
                in the field for over three years.
